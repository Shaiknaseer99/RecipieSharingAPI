// signup and login functionality 

note : not using any signin with google we can check in the frontend if we need


user = [

    name ,
    email,
    password,
    bio  : it contains some description about the user like we have in the instagram,
    profile pic : string later in the frontend we can see 
    // in front end we can keep other options as well to keep things up 

]
signup = [
    name , 
    email ,
    password
]
//i can retrieve all the above using the user model 
login = [
    email , password
]
// for the passwords i need to hash the password we want it right 

2 . routes folder we want signin and signout functionality

// other than login and sign up what we are doing is we are putting the protected routes 
//for the  we are putting the middleware 

//the above includes the user authentication and user management

// next step is to create recipe routes
in this the user can see all the recipes
search for a specific recipe  using keywords
-- user can  create a recipe
--user can also publish a recipe 


// recipe model
 recipeSchema = [
    // id will be created by default by mongodb
    recipeName,
    description ,
    recipeInstruction,
    photos  : [ ]
    // array for putting multiple photos we are keeping it as string as now
 ]
// in the users can save the recipes 
// this is mostly like saving the recipes to the user profile and the other things
//there should be a button when  i click on the save button and 
// lets do it normal way default
// the  user will give the id and hit the save recipe route and i will collect it and save in the user profile

//there should be two functionalities like saving the recipe and getall saved recipes


community interaction

// users can follow the other users -- need to implement the functionality
//work on the rating and then on the feedback
